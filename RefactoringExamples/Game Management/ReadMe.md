A significant refactoring we were able to perform was in the GameManagement class. Within the class, we had a single function handling all of the responsibility, BeginGame(). This function did everything from placing ships, initializing variables, taking turns, performing special shots, etc. We found that this was way too much responsibility on a single function and made the flow of our game very hard to read and understand. We split up the function in multiple functions, allowing for better readability and flow. We now have a constructor that initializes everything the game needs, a initializeGame function that places the ships, a Sonar and SpecialShot function to handle those abilities, an EndGame function that checks to make sure the game is not over, and a much smaller BeginGame function, that handles the shots and turns.
