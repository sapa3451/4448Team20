Throughout our refactoring stages in our project development, IntelliJ provided us with amazing tools to help find the small possible refactorings that we would have never thought of. These tools highlighted problems such as redundent declarations, unused variables, for loops that could be simplified, and unused imports, all of which can be hard to catch is such a large project. While there are far too many of these to provide examples of each, we used these tools after every major feature, refactor, and milestone to find the small refactorings that would make our code more readable and clean.
