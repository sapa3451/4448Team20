A lazy class refers to one that isn't doing enough to pay for itself. In our case, we had an abstract Board class that has 2 subclasses, UnderwaterBoard and AirBoard. This refactoring was a significant one, allowing us to get rid of these two subclasses that had little to no responsibilities. The responsibilities they did have, were duplicate algorithms that could be refactored into one. They were only dealing with the changes that were needed for the different depths they had. We got rid of the extended classes and changed the Board class to be a single class. Instead, Board now has a z-value that represents the depth and height of the board, allowing for a simplification and easier instantiation of the boards without the need for subclasses that have no major responsibilities and duplicate code.
