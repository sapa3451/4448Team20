This refactoring was a significant one, allowing us to get rid of 2 classes that had little to no responsibilities, our UnderwaterBoard and our AirBoard. The responsibilities they did have, were duplicate algorithms that could be refactored into one. We got rid of the exetneded classes, changed the Board class to be a single class. Instead, it now has a z value that represents the depth and height of the board, allowing for a simplification and easier instantiation of the boards
