Another significant smell, we found that our game was very dependent on our assumed order of the boards. If the player did not order their boards in creation by air, surface, and then underwater, the game did not run. One change in the order caused a cascade of problems throughout almost every class. We did a major shotgun surgery fix and went through and changed each part that was dependent on the ordering of the boards, to now look at a board's z value instead. So, no matter the order or the amount of boards, our functions will iterate through all of them properly when called to.
