We were able to refactor our board factory so that it is not dependent on the specific types of boards: air, surface, and underwater. We found that this could lead to limitations with z values in the future and cause more change in the code that could be prevented. Instead, we were able to change the board factory to take in a z value instead of a string type. This way, the baord is created no matter what, with any z value, instead of a set z value.
