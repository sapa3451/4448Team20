Dealing with our interfaces, we found that we had redundant interfaces dealing with our boards that had almost identical behavior causing hundreds of lines of duplicated code. Our show behaviors were initially made to differentiate between different elevations of the boards; air, surface, and underwater. We found that once we had refactored the Board class to become a single class with a z value, these show behaviors became redundant and unnecessary. We found a way to refactor our 6 show behavior classes down to 2 show behavior classes, one for the player and one for the computer, using the board's z value to now implement the needed differences. Also, we found that once we had a single Board class, we could once again reduce a behavior interface, our MarkBehavior, to now just be a function within the Board class itself. This was a middle man problem, as the Board was delegating responsibility to an interface that only had a single behavior. The interface would delegate the responsibility to the single behavior that never changes. We removed the MarkBehavior interface as a whole and reduced it to a function within Board itself, cutting out the middleman.
