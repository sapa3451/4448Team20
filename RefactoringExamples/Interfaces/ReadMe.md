Dealing with our interfaces, we found that we had redundent interfaces that had almost identical behavior causing hundreds of lines of duplicated code. Our show behaviors were initially made to differentiate between different elevations of the boards; air, surface, and underwater. We found that once we had refactored the Board class to become a single class with a z value, these show behaviors became redundent. We found a way to refactor our 6 show behavior classes down to 2 show behavior classes, one for the player and one for the computer, using the board's z value to now implement the needed differences. Also, we found that once we had a single Board class, we could once again reduce a behavior interface, our MarkBehavior, to now just be a function within the Board class itself. This was a middle man problem, as the Board was delegating unnecessary responsibility to an interface that only had a single behavior. This allowed us to get rid of both an unnecessary class and interface in our project.
